# Automatically Classify Consumer Goods

Introduction:

The company "Marketplace" is currently developing an e-commerce marketplace. The platform allows sellers to offer their items to buyers by publishing a photo and a description. However, the manual assignment of categories to items by sellers is unreliable, and the current volume of items on the platform is still limited. In order to enhance user experience and prepare for future expansion, it has become necessary to automate this task.

Mission:

Our mission is to study the feasibility of an automatic classification engine for items on our marketplace. The goal is to implement a system capable of automatically assigning categories to items based on their description and image.
